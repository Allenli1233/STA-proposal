    "## Research Problem\n",
    "The purpose of this study is to examine whether specific mental health and social support indices significantly impact individual well-being. We will test whether subjective happiness, depression screening scores, and social loneliness are predictive of life satisfaction. This will help us understand which aspects of mental and social health are more crucial in contributing to overall well-being.\n",

    "### Variables\n",
    "1. **WELLNESS_phq_score** (PHQ Score): A screening score for depression, used as an indicator of mental wellness. We hypothesize that the mean PHQ score aligns with the known population average.\n",
    "2. **LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score** (UCLA Loneliness Scale): A measure of social loneliness. We will compare loneliness scores based on recent friendship formation.\n",
    "3. **WELLNESS_life_satisfaction** and **LONELY_dejong_social_loneliness_sub_scale_score**: Measures of life satisfaction and social loneliness, where we’ll examine if an inverse relationship exists, suggesting that lower loneliness is associated with higher life satisfaction.\n"

The bootstrap confidence interval for the mean will help us determine whether this variable significantly differs from the expected average, allowing us to decide if the null hypothesis should be rejected.\n"

    "## 2a. Potential Outcomes and Relation to Course Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-sample hypothesis test**: If the bootstrap confidence interval excludes the population mean, it suggests unique characteristics in the sample's mental wellness, possibly due to specific social or environmental factors. This aligns with course goals to understand variances in mental health within different demographics.\n",
    "\n",

This supports course objectives by identifying social factors that impact well-being.\n",

    "1. **PHQ Score**: We may find the PHQ score significantly differs from the known population mean, indicating distinct mental health trends in the sample.\n",
